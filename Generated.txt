Ephesians 1:1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians 1:2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 1:3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.
Ephesians 1:4	For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love
Ephesians 1:5	He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will,
Ephesians 1:6	to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One.
Ephesians 1:7	In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace,
Ephesians 1:8	that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
Ephesians 1:9	And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ
Ephesians 1:10	as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ.
Ephesians 1:11	In Him we were also chosen as God’s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will,
Ephesians 1:12	in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory.
Ephesians 1:13	And in Him you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, having heard and believed the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.
Ephesians 1:14	The Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians 1:15	For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
Ephesians 1:16	I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers
Ephesians 1:17	and asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in your knowledge of Him.
Ephesians 1:18	I ask that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians 1:19	and the surpassing greatness of His power to us who believe. He displayed this power in the working of His mighty strength,
Ephesians 1:20	which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms,
Ephesians 1:21	far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
Ephesians 1:22	And God put everything under His feet and made Him head over everything for the church,
Ephesians 1:23	which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
Ephesians 2:1	As for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
Ephesians 2:2	in which you used to walk when you conformed to the ways of this world and of the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians 2:3	We all lived among them at one time in the cravings of our flesh, indulging its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature children of wrath.
Ephesians 2:4	But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,
Ephesians 2:5	made us alive with Christ, even when we were dead in our trespasses. It is by grace you have been saved!
Ephesians 2:6	And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
Ephesians 2:7	in order that in the coming ages He might display the surpassing riches of His grace, demonstrated by His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians 2:8	For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,
Ephesians 2:9	not by works, so that no one can boast.
Ephesians 2:10	For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance as our way of life.
Ephesians 2:11	Therefore remember that formerly you who are Gentiles in the flesh and called uncircumcised by the so-called circumcision (that done in the body by human hands)—
Ephesians 2:12	remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
Ephesians 2:13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
Ephesians 2:14	For He Himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has torn down the dividing wall of hostility
Ephesians 2:15	by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments and decrees. He did this to create in Himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace
Ephesians 2:16	and reconciling both of them to God in one body through the cross, by which He extinguished their hostility.
Ephesians 2:17	He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
Ephesians 2:18	For through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
Ephesians 2:19	Therefore you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens of the saints and members of God’s household,
Ephesians 2:20	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone.
Ephesians 2:21	In Him the whole building is fitted together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
Ephesians 2:22	And in Him you too are being built together into a dwelling place for God in His Spirit.
Ephesians 3:1	For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles...
Ephesians 3:2	Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,
Ephesians 3:3	that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.
Ephesians 3:4	In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
Ephesians 3:5	which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.
Ephesians 3:6	This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians 3:7	I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of His power.
Ephesians 3:8	Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
Ephesians 3:9	and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship of this mystery, which for ages past was hidden in God, who created all things.
Ephesians 3:10	His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,
Ephesians 3:11	according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Ephesians 3:12	In Him and through faith in Him we may enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence.
Ephesians 3:13	So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
Ephesians 3:14	... for this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
Ephesians 3:15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
Ephesians 3:16	I pray that out of the riches of His glory, He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being,
Ephesians 3:17	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians 3:18	may have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth of His love,
Ephesians 3:19	and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
Ephesians 3:20	Now to Him who is able to do infinitely more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,
Ephesians 3:21	to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
Ephesians 4:1	As a prisoner in the Lord, then, I urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling you have received:
Ephesians 4:2	with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
Ephesians 4:3	and with diligence to preserve the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
Ephesians 4:4	There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called;
Ephesians 4:5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
Ephesians 4:6	one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
Ephesians 4:7	Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians 4:8	This is why it says: “When He ascended on high, He led captives away, and gave gifts to men.”
Ephesians 4:9	What does “He ascended” mean, except that He also descended to the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians 4:10	He who descended is the very one who ascended above all the heavens, in order to fill all things.
Ephesians 4:11	And it was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,
Ephesians 4:12	to equip the saints for works of ministry, to build up the body of Christ,
Ephesians 4:13	until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ.
Ephesians 4:14	Then we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming.
Ephesians 4:15	Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ Himself, who is the head.
Ephesians 4:16	From Him the whole body is fitted and held together by every supporting ligament. And as each individual part does its work, the body grows and builds itself up in love.
Ephesians 4:17	So I tell you this, and testify to it in the Lord: You must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
Ephesians 4:18	They are darkened in their understanding and alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts.
Ephesians 4:19	Having lost all sense of shame, they have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity, with a craving for more.
Ephesians 4:20	But this is not the way you came to know Christ.
Ephesians 4:21	Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him in keeping with the truth that is in Jesus.
Ephesians 4:22	You were taught to put off your former way of life, your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
Ephesians 4:23	to be renewed in the spirit of your minds;
Ephesians 4:24	and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
Ephesians 4:25	Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are members of one another.
Ephesians 4:26	“Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let the sun set upon your anger,
Ephesians 4:27	and do not give the devil a foothold.
Ephesians 4:28	He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing good with his own hands, that he may have something to share with the one in need.
Ephesians 4:29	Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building up the one in need and bringing grace to those who listen.
Ephesians 4:30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Ephesians 4:31	Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, outcry and slander, along with every form of malice.
Ephesians 4:32	Be kind and tender-hearted to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you.
Ephesians 5:1	Be imitators of God, therefore, as beloved children,
Ephesians 5:2	and walk in love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant sacrificial offering to God.
Ephesians 5:3	But among you, as is proper among the saints, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality or impurity or greed.
Ephesians 5:4	Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of character, but rather thanksgiving.
Ephesians 5:5	For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Ephesians 5:6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians 5:7	Therefore do not be partakers with them.
Ephesians 5:8	For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
Ephesians 5:9	for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
Ephesians 5:10	Test and prove what pleases the Lord.
Ephesians 5:11	Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
Ephesians 5:12	For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
Ephesians 5:13	But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself.
Ephesians 5:14	So it is said: “Wake up, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”
Ephesians 5:15	Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
Ephesians 5:16	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians 5:17	Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.
Ephesians 5:18	Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.
Ephesians 5:19	Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord,
Ephesians 5:20	always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 5:21	Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
Ephesians 5:22	Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
Ephesians 5:23	For the husband is head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior.
Ephesians 5:24	Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
Ephesians 5:25	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her
Ephesians 5:26	to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
Ephesians 5:27	and to present her to Himself as a glorious church, without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.
Ephesians 5:28	In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
Ephesians 5:29	Indeed, no one ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church.
Ephesians 5:30	For we are members of His body.
Ephesians 5:31	“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”
Ephesians 5:32	This mystery is profound, but I am speaking about Christ and the church.
Ephesians 5:33	Nevertheless, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
Ephesians 6:1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Ephesians 6:2	“Honor your father and mother” (which is the first commandment with a promise),
Ephesians 6:3	“that it may go well with you and that you may be long-lived on the earth.”
Ephesians 6:4	Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger; instead, bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
Ephesians 6:5	Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and sincerity of heart, just as you would show to Christ.
Ephesians 6:6	And do this not only to please them while they are watching, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.
Ephesians 6:7	Serve with good will, as to the Lord and not to men,
Ephesians 6:8	because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.
Ephesians 6:9	And masters, do the same for your slaves. Give up your use of threats, because you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.
Ephesians 6:10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
Ephesians 6:11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you can make your stand against the devil’s schemes.
Ephesians 6:12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this world's darkness, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
Ephesians 6:13	Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your ground, and having done everything, to stand.
Ephesians 6:14	Stand firm then, with the belt of truth fastened around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness arrayed,
Ephesians 6:15	and with your feet fitted with the readiness of the gospel of peace.
Ephesians 6:16	In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
Ephesians 6:17	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
Ephesians 6:18	Pray in the Spirit at all times, with every kind of prayer and petition. To this end, stay alert with all perseverance in your prayers for all the saints.
Ephesians 6:19	Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, divine utterance may be given me, so that I will boldly make known the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians 6:20	for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly, as I should.
Ephesians 6:21	Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know about me and what I am doing.
Ephesians 6:22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about us, and that he may encourage your hearts.
Ephesians 6:23	Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 6:24	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
Colossians 1:1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
Colossians 1:2	To the saints in Colossae, the faithful brothers in Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
Colossians 1:3	We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
Colossians 1:4	because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints,
Colossians 1:5	springing from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel
Colossians 1:6	that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood the grace of God.
Colossians 1:7	You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,
Colossians 1:8	and who also informed us of your love in the Spirit.
Colossians 1:9	For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
Colossians 1:10	so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord and may please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,
Colossians 1:11	being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have full endurance and patience, and joyfully
Colossians 1:12	giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.
Colossians 1:13	He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of His beloved Son,
Colossians 1:14	in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
Colossians 1:15	The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
Colossians 1:16	For in Him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through Him and for Him.
Colossians 1:17	He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
Colossians 1:18	And He is the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning and firstborn from among the dead, so that in all things He may have preeminence.
Colossians 1:19	For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him,
Colossians 1:20	and through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through the blood of His cross.
Colossians 1:21	Once you were alienated from God and were hostile in your minds because of your evil deeds.
Colossians 1:22	But now He has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless in His presence—
Colossians 1:23	if indeed you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope of the gospel you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
Colossians 1:24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions for the sake of His body, which is the church.
Colossians 1:25	I became its servant by the commission God gave me to fully proclaim to you the word of God,
Colossians 1:26	the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations but is now revealed to His saints,
Colossians 1:27	to whom God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
Colossians 1:28	We proclaim Him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.
Colossians 1:29	To this end I labor, striving with all His energy working powerfully within me.
Colossians 2:1	I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me face to face,
Colossians 2:2	that they may be encouraged in heart, knit together in love, and filled with the full riches of complete understanding, so that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ,
Colossians 2:3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians 2:4	I say this so that no one will deceive you by smooth rhetoric.
Colossians 2:5	For although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I delight to see your orderly condition and firm faith in Christ.
Colossians 2:6	Therefore, just as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him,
Colossians 2:7	rooted and built up in Him, established in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
Colossians 2:8	See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, which are based on human tradition and the spiritual forces of the world rather than on Christ.
Colossians 2:9	For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form.
Colossians 2:10	And you have been made complete in Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.
Colossians 2:11	In Him you were also circumcised in the putting off of your sinful nature, with the circumcision performed by Christ and not by human hands.
Colossians 2:12	And having been buried with Him in baptism, you were raised with Him through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead.
Colossians 2:13	When you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our trespasses,
Colossians 2:14	having canceled the debt ascribed to us in the decrees that stood against us. He took it away, nailing it to the cross!
Colossians 2:15	And having disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
Colossians 2:16	Therefore let no one judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a festival, a New Moon, or a Sabbath.
Colossians 2:17	These are a shadow of the things to come, but the body that casts it belongs to Christ.
Colossians 2:18	Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you with speculation about what he has seen. Such a man is puffed up without basis by his unspiritual mind,
Colossians 2:19	and he loses connection to the head, from whom the whole body, supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments, grows as God causes it to grow.
Colossians 2:20	If you have died with Christ to the spiritual forces of the world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its regulations:
Colossians 2:21	“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”?
Colossians 2:22	These will all perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.
Colossians 2:23	Such restrictions indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-prescribed worship, their false humility, and their harsh treatment of the body; but they are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.
Colossians 3:1	Therefore, since you have been raised with Christ, strive for the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
Colossians 3:2	Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
Colossians 3:3	For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
Colossians 3:4	When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.
Colossians 3:5	Put to death, therefore, the components of your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.
Colossians 3:6	Because of these, the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.
Colossians 3:7	When you lived among them, you also used to walk in these ways.
Colossians 3:8	But now you must put aside all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth.
Colossians 3:9	Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices,
Colossians 3:10	and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.
Colossians 3:11	Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all and is in all.
Colossians 3:12	Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
Colossians 3:13	Bear with each other and forgive any complaint you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
Colossians 3:14	And over all these virtues put on love, which is the bond of perfect unity.
Colossians 3:15	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, for to this you were called as members of one body. And be thankful.
Colossians 3:16	Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.
Colossians 3:17	And whatever you do, in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
Colossians 3:18	Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Colossians 3:19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
Colossians 3:20	Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.
Colossians 3:21	Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become discouraged.
Colossians 3:22	Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only to please them while they are watching, but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord.
Colossians 3:23	Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being, for the Lord and not for men,
Colossians 3:24	because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as your reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
Colossians 3:25	Whoever does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.
Colossians 4:1	Masters, supply your slaves with what is right and fair, since you know that you also have a Master in heaven.
Colossians 4:2	Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful,
Colossians 4:3	as you pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.
Colossians 4:4	Pray that I may declare it clearly, as I should.
Colossians 4:5	Act wisely toward outsiders, redeeming the time.
Colossians 4:6	Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.
Colossians 4:7	Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a beloved brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.
Colossians 4:8	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about us, and that he may encourage your hearts.
Colossians 4:9	With him I am sending Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.
Colossians 4:10	My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you greetings, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas. You have already received instructions about him: If he comes to you, welcome him.
Colossians 4:11	Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
Colossians 4:12	Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in the full will of God.
Colossians 4:13	For I testify about him that he goes to great pains for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.
Colossians 4:14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas send you greetings.
Colossians 4:15	Greet the brothers in Laodicea, as well as Nympha and the church that meets at her house.
Colossians 4:16	After this letter has been read among you, make sure that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.
Colossians 4:17	Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”
Colossians 4:18	This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
Philemon 1:1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker,
Philemon 1:2	to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets at your house:
Philemon 1:3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon 1:4	I always thank my God, making mention of you in my prayers,
Philemon 1:5	because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
Philemon 1:6	I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing that is ours in Christ.
Philemon 1:7	I take great joy and encouragement in your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
Philemon 1:8	So although in Christ I am fully confident that I could order you to do what is proper,
Philemon 1:9	I prefer to appeal on the basis of love. For I, Paul, am now aged, and a prisoner of Christ Jesus as well.
Philemon 1:10	I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whose father I became while I was in chains.
Philemon 1:11	Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
Philemon 1:12	I am sending back to you him who is my very heart.
Philemon 1:13	I would have liked to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he could minister to me in my chains for the gospel.
Philemon 1:14	But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness will not be out of compulsion, but by your own free will.
Philemon 1:15	For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back for good—
Philemon 1:16	no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is especially beloved to me, but even more so to you, both in person and in the Lord.
Philemon 1:17	So if you consider me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
Philemon 1:18	But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.
Philemon 1:19	I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your very self.
Philemon 1:20	Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon 1:21	Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
Philemon 1:22	In the meantime, prepare a guest room for me, because I hope that through your prayers, I will be restored to you.
Philemon 1:23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,
Philemon 1:24	as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
Philemon 1:25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
